# Bitcoin Protozoa Implementation Scripts

This directory contains scripts for implementing the Bitcoin Protozoa project components.

## Basic Particle System Implementation

These scripts implement the Basic Particle System components for Phase 1 of the project:

- `implement-basic-particle-system.ps1`: Master script that orchestrates the implementation process
- `implement-particle-class.ps1`: Implements the basic particle class with position, velocity, and acceleration
- `implement-particle-renderer.ps1`: Implements the particle renderer using Three.js
- `implement-physics-engine.ps1`: Implements the basic physics engine for particle movement
- `implement-particle-container.ps1`: Implements the particle container component
- `implement-state-management.ps1`: Sets up Zustand store for application state
- `fix-component-styles.ps1`: Fixes styles.ts files for components

## Usage

To implement the Basic Particle System, run the master script:

```powershell
.\implement-basic-particle-system.ps1
```

This will guide you through the implementation process, allowing you to run each implementation script in sequence.

Alternatively, you can run individual scripts to implement specific components:

```powershell
.\implement-particle-class.ps1
.\implement-particle-renderer.ps1
.\implement-physics-engine.ps1
.\implement-particle-container.ps1
.\implement-state-management.ps1
```

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the project requirements outlined in the [Project Checklist](../../bitcoin_protozoa/project/01_project_checklist.md) and adheres to the architecture defined in the [Module Structure](../../bitcoin_protozoa/core/03_module_structure.md) document.

Key features implemented:

1. **Particle Class**: A comprehensive particle interface with physical, visual, and behavioral properties
2. **Particle Renderer**: An efficient renderer using instanced meshes for optimal performance
3. **Physics Engine**: A basic physics engine with Verlet integration for stable simulations
4. **Particle Container**: A container component that manages particles and integrates with the physics engine
5. **State Management**: A global state store using Zustand for managing application state

## Next Steps

After implementing the Basic Particle System, the next phase is Bitcoin Integration, which will be implemented in a separate set of scripts.
