# Deployment Summary

This directory contains documentation on the development workflow, deployment pipeline, and asset management for the Bitcoin Protozoa project.

## Key Documents

- [Development Workflow](01_development_workflow.md) - Development process and environment
- [Deployment Pipeline](02_deployment_pipeline.md) - Ordinals inscription pipeline
- [Asset Management](03_asset_management.md) - Asset management strategy

## Development Workflow Overview

The development workflow is designed to ensure efficient development and testing:

1. **Engine First**: Building the particle engine before preparing for inscription
2. **Incremental Testing**: Testing components incrementally
3. **Local Development**: Using local development environment with mock Bitcoin data
4. **Optimization Phase**: Optimizing for performance and size
5. **Inscription Preparation**: Preparing for Ordinals inscription

## Development Phases

The development process is divided into several phases:

1. **Engine Development**: Building the core particle and physics engine
2. **UI Development**: Creating the user interface
3. **Bitcoin Integration**: Implementing Bitcoin data integration
4. **Optimization**: Optimizing for performance and size
5. **Inscription Preparation**: Preparing for Ordinals inscription
6. **Deployment**: Inscribing on Bitcoin

## Deployment Pipeline

The deployment pipeline handles the process of inscribing the application on Bitcoin:

1. **Build Optimization**: Optimizing the build for inscription
2. **Chunk Preparation**: Splitting the application into optimal chunks
3. **Inscription Order Planning**: Planning the order of inscriptions
4. **Inscription Process**: Inscribing chunks on Bitcoin
5. **Verification**: Verifying inscriptions
6. **Monitoring**: Monitoring inscription health

## Asset Management

The asset management strategy ensures efficient organization and loading of assets:

1. **Type Definitions**: Pre-defining all types
2. **Class Definitions**: Pre-defining all classes
3. **Function Definitions**: Pre-defining all functions
4. **Module Structure**: Organizing code into modules
5. **Import/Export Chain**: Managing dependencies
6. **Asset Loading**: Optimizing asset loading
7. **Asset Versioning**: Managing asset versions
