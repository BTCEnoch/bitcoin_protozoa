## Subclass Modifiers

Each MOVEMENT subclass is further modified by the ordering of the remaining four roles:

- **CONTROL**: Adds crowd control or utility effects to movement abilities
- **ATTACK**: Adds damage or offensive effects to movement abilities
- **DEFENSE**: Adds protection or damage reduction effects to movement abilities

## Integration with Traits

MOVEMENT subclasses integrate with the trait system in several ways:

- **Formation Traits**: Modify the spatial arrangement of particles, affecting movement patterns
- **Behavior Traits**: Modify how the subclass moves and interacts with the environment
- **Mutation Traits**: Provide additional bonuses and enhancements triggered by Bitcoin confirmation milestones

## Gameplay Considerations

- MOVEMENT subclasses excel at mobility and evasion but may lack durability
- Higher rarity subclasses have more complex movement patterns and stronger utility effects
- The ordering of secondary roles creates unique playstyles within each subclass
- MOVEMENT subclasses counter CONTROL subclasses but are countered by ATTACK subclasses
- The hybrid nature of MOVEMENT subclasses makes them versatile and adaptable to different situations
