2. **CONTROL**
   - **Purpose**: Directs the behavior of other roles, functioning as the creature's "brain."
   - **Positioning**: Orbits around the CORE, maintaining a dynamic yet structured presence.

3. **MOVEMENT**
   - **Purpose**: Enables the creature's locomotion, serving as its "fins" or "appendages."
   - **Positioning**: Extends outward from the CORE, typically at the periphery for propulsion.

4. **DEFENSE**
