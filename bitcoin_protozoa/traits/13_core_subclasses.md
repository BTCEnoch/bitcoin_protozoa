## Subclass Modifiers

Each CORE subclass is further modified by the ordering of the remaining four roles:

- **CONTROL**: Adds utility or crowd control effects to healing abilities
- **ATTACK**: Adds damage or offensive effects to healing abilities
- **DEFENSE**: Adds protection or damage reduction effects to healing abilities
- **MOVEMENT**: Adds speed or mobility effects to healing abilities

## Integration with Traits

CORE subclasses integrate with the trait system in several ways:

- **Formation Traits**: Modify the spatial arrangement of particles, affecting healing patterns
- **Behavior Traits**: Modify how the subclass moves and interacts with the environment
- **Mutation Traits**: Provide additional bonuses and enhancements triggered by Bitcoin confirmation milestones

## Gameplay Considerations

- CORE subclasses excel at healing and support but may lack offensive capabilities
- Higher rarity subclasses have stronger healing abilities and crowd control effects
- The ordering of secondary roles creates unique playstyles within each subclass
- CORE subclasses counter ATTACK subclasses but are countered by CONTROL subclasses
- Dispel abilities (removing debuffs) are a key feature of CORE subclasses, especially at higher rarities
