## Overview

The trait system is a core component of the Bitcoin Protozoa project, responsible for defining the characteristics, behaviors, and appearances of particle creatures. Traits are deterministically generated based on Bitcoin block data, ensuring that creatures are unique but reproducible given the same block height.

Each particle creature consists of five distinct particle groups (CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK), with each group having its own set of traits that influence its appearance, behavior, and interactions with other groups.

## Core Concepts

### Deterministic RNG-Based Trait Assignment

All traits are assigned using a deterministic RNG chain based on the Bitcoin block nonce:

```typescript
// Start with block nonce as seed
const initialSeed = blockData.nonce;
const rng = mulberry32(initialSeed);

// Create a chain of RNG values for different trait categories
const traitRNG = {
  visual: createChainRNG(rng(), 'visual'),
  formation: createChainRNG(rng(), 'formation'),
  behavior: createChainRNG(rng(), 'behavior'),
  force: createChainRNG(rng(), 'force')
};

// Function to create a chained RNG for a specific trait category
function createChainRNG(seed: number, purpose: string): () => number {
  let currentSeed = seed;
  return () => {
    currentSeed = mulberry32(currentSeed)();
    return currentSeed;
  };
}
```

This approach ensures that:
- Traits are deterministically generated from the block nonce
- Different trait categories have independent but deterministic RNG streams
- The same block always produces the same traits

### Group-Based Trait Application

Traits are applied at the group level, with each of the five role groups receiving their own set of traits:

```typescript
// Assign traits to each group
Object.keys(groups).forEach(groupId => {
  const group = groups[groupId];
  assignTraitsToGroup(group, traitRNG);
});

function assignTraitsToGroup(group: ParticleGroup, traitRNG: TraitRNG) {
  // Assign traits based on group role
  const roleSpecificTraits = getRoleSpecificTraitOptions(group.role);

  // Assign visual traits
  group.visualTraits = selectTraitFromArray(
    roleSpecificTraits.visualOptions,
    traitRNG.visual()
  );

  // Assign formation traits
  group.formationTraits = selectTraitFromArray(
    roleSpecificTraits.formationOptions,
    traitRNG.formation()
  );

  // Assign behavior traits
  group.behaviorTraits = selectTraitFromArray(
    roleSpecificTraits.behaviorOptions,
    traitRNG.behavior()
  );

  // Assign force calculation traits
  group.forceTraits = selectTraitFromArray(
    roleSpecificTraits.forceOptions,
    traitRNG.force()
  );
}
```

This group-based approach allows for:
- Role-specific trait options
- Independent trait selection for each group
- Complex emergent behaviors from group interactions

## Group Attributes

Each particle group has the following core attributes:

### Physical Attributes

1. **Perception**: Defines the interaction radius for the group
   - Determines how far the group can "sense" other groups
   - Affects interaction behaviors
   - Role-specific base values with RNG variation

2. **Force Field Shape**: Defines the boundary container for the group
   - Invisible in the final rendering
   - Affects particle containment and movement
   - Role-specific options selected by RNG

3. **Scale**: Defines the overall size of the group
   - Affects visual appearance and physics interactions
   - Role-specific base values with RNG variation

4. **Particle Shape**: Defines the shape of individual particles
   - Affects visual appearance
   - Role-specific options selected by RNG

### Visual Attributes

1. **Color**: Defines the color scheme for the group
   - RGB values determined by RNG
   - Role-specific base colors with variation
   - May be affected by mutations

2. **Visual Effects**: Special visual properties
   - Selected from an array of possible effects by RNG
   - Organized in preset combinations
   - Examples: trails, glow, pulse effects, etc.

### Force Calculation Attributes

1. **Attraction/Repulsion Values**: Defines how the group interacts with other groups
   - Matrix of values between -1 (repulsion) and 1 (attraction)
   - Each group has values for interaction with each other group
   - Creates complex emergent behaviors

## Trait Assignment Process

### Deterministic RNG-Based Assignment

1. **Initialize RNG Chain**:
```typescript
// Start with block nonce as seed
const initialSeed = blockData.nonce;
const rng = mulberry32(initialSeed);

// Create a chain of RNG values for different trait categories
const traitRNG = {
  visual: createChainRNG(rng(), 'visual'),
  formation: createChainRNG(rng(), 'formation'),
  behavior: createChainRNG(rng(), 'behavior'),
  force: createChainRNG(rng(), 'force')
};

// Function to create a chained RNG for a specific trait category
function createChainRNG(seed: number, purpose: string): () => number {
  let currentSeed = seed;
  return () => {
    currentSeed = mulberry32(currentSeed)();
    return currentSeed;
  };
}
```

### Rarity Determination

```typescript
function determineRarity(rng: () => number): Rarity {
  const roll = rng();

  if (roll < 0.005) return Rarity.MYTHIC;       // 0.5% chance
  if (roll < 0.02) return Rarity.LEGENDARY;     // 1.5% chance
  if (roll < 0.10) return Rarity.EPIC;          // 8% chance
  if (roll < 0.30) return Rarity.RARE;          // 20% chance
  if (roll < 0.60) return Rarity.UNCOMMON;      // 30% chance
  return Rarity.COMMON;                         // 40% chance
}
```

### Trait Selection

```typescript
function selectTraitByRarity(category: string, role: ParticleRole, rarity: Rarity, rng: () => number): Trait {
  // Get available traits for this category, role, and rarity
  const availableTraits = getTraitsForCategoryRoleRarity(category, role, rarity);

  // Select a random trait from available options
  const traitIndex = Math.floor(rng() * availableTraits.length);
  return availableTraits[traitIndex];
}

function assignTraitsToGroup(group: ParticleGroup, traitRNG: TraitRNG) {
  // Determine rarity for each trait category
  const visualRarity = determineRarity(traitRNG.visual());
  const formationRarity = determineRarity(traitRNG.formation());
  const behaviorRarity = determineRarity(traitRNG.behavior());
  const forceRarity = determineRarity(traitRNG.force());

  // Assign visual traits
  group.visualTraits = {
    shape: selectTraitByRarity('particleShape', group.role, visualRarity, traitRNG.visual()),
    color: selectTraitByRarity('colorScheme', group.role, visualRarity, traitRNG.visual()),
    effects: selectTraitByRarity('visualEffects', group.role, visualRarity, traitRNG.visual())
  };

  // Assign formation traits
  group.formationTraits = selectTraitByRarity(
    'formation',
    group.role,
    formationRarity,
    traitRNG.formation()
  );

  // Assign behavior traits
  group.behaviorTraits = selectTraitByRarity(
    'behavior',
    group.role,
    behaviorRarity,
    traitRNG.behavior()
  );

  // Assign force calculation traits
  group.forceTraits = {
    attractionProfile: selectTraitByRarity('attractionProfile', group.role, forceRarity, traitRNG.force()),
    fieldProperties: selectTraitByRarity('fieldProperties', group.role, forceRarity, traitRNG.force())
  };
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Trait Data Structure

```typescript
enum Rarity {
  COMMON = 'common',
  UNCOMMON = 'uncommon',
  RARE = 'rare',
  EPIC = 'epic',
  LEGENDARY = 'legendary',
  MYTHIC = 'mythic'
}

interface Trait {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  rarity: Rarity;
  value: any;
  properties?: Record<string, any>;
}

interface GroupTraits {
  // Physical traits
  perception: number;
  forceFieldShape: Trait;
  scale: number;
  particleShape: Trait;

  // Visual traits
  visualTraits: {
    shape: Trait;
    color: Trait;
    effects: Trait;
  };

  // Formation traits
  formationTraits: Trait;

  // Behavior traits
  behaviorTraits: Trait;

  // Force calculation traits
  forceTraits: {
    attractionProfile: Trait;
    fieldProperties: Trait;
  };

  // Interaction matrix
  interactionMatrix: Record<string, number>; // Group ID -> attraction/repulsion value
}
```

### Trait Visualization

Visual traits should be implemented with clear visual distinctions based on rarity:

```typescript
// Apply shape based on trait
const geometry = geometries[group.visualTraits.shape.value];

// Apply color scheme based on trait
const colorScheme = group.visualTraits.color.value;

// Create material based on rarity
let material;
switch (group.visualTraits.color.rarity) {
  case Rarity.COMMON:
  case Rarity.UNCOMMON:
    // Simple material for common/uncommon
    material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
      color: new THREE.Color(colorScheme.r, colorScheme.g, colorScheme.b),
      emissive: new THREE.Color(colorScheme.r * 0.5, colorScheme.g * 0.5, colorScheme.b * 0.5),
      emissiveIntensity: 0.5
    });
    break;

  case Rarity.RARE:
  case Rarity.EPIC:
    // Advanced material for rare/epic
    material = createAdvancedMaterial(colorScheme);
    break;

  case Rarity.LEGENDARY:
  case Rarity.MYTHIC:
    // Custom shader material for legendary/mythic
    material = createCustomShaderMaterial(colorScheme, group.visualTraits.color.rarity);
    break;
}
```

### Behavior Implementation

Behaviors should be implemented as modular components with rarity-based complexity:

```typescript
function applyBehavior(group: ParticleGroup, behaviorTrait: Trait) {
  const behaviorType = behaviorTrait.value;
  const properties = behaviorTrait.properties || {};
  const rarity = behaviorTrait.rarity;

  // Base implementation
  let behaviorImplementation;

  switch (behaviorType) {
    case 'flocking':
      behaviorImplementation = createFlockingBehavior(properties);
      break;

    case 'pulsation':
      behaviorImplementation = createPulsationBehavior(properties);
      break;

    case 'rotation':
      behaviorImplementation = createRotationBehavior(properties);
      break;

    // Other behavior types
  }

  // Enhance based on rarity
  if (rarity >= Rarity.RARE) {
    behaviorImplementation = enhanceBehavior(behaviorImplementation, rarity);
  }

  // Apply to group
  group.addBehavior(behaviorImplementation);
}
```
