## Subclass Modifiers

Each DEFENSE subclass is further modified by the ordering of the remaining four roles:

- **CONTROL**: Adds crowd control or utility effects to defensive abilities
- **ATTACK**: Adds damage or offensive effects to defensive abilities
- **MOVEMENT**: Adds speed or mobility effects to defensive abilities

## Integration with Traits

DEFENSE subclasses integrate with the trait system in several ways:

- **Formation Traits**: Modify the spatial arrangement of particles, affecting defensive patterns
- **Behavior Traits**: Modify how the subclass moves and interacts with the environment
- **Mutation Traits**: Provide additional bonuses and enhancements triggered by Bitcoin confirmation milestones

## Gameplay Considerations

- DEFENSE subclasses excel at absorbing damage and protecting allies but may lack mobility
- Higher rarity subclasses have stronger defensive abilities and crowd control effects
- The ordering of secondary roles creates unique playstyles within each subclass
- DEFENSE subclasses counter ATTACK subclasses but are countered by CONTROL subclasses
