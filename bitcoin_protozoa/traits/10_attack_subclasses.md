## Subclass Modifiers

Each ATTACK subclass is further modified by the ordering of the remaining four roles:

- **CONTROL**: Adds crowd control or utility effects to attacks
- **DEFENSE**: Adds protection or damage reduction effects
- **MOVEMENT**: Adds speed or mobility effects to attacks

## Integration with Traits

ATTACK subclasses integrate with the trait system in several ways:

- **Formation Traits**: Modify the spatial arrangement of particles, affecting attack patterns
- **Behavior Traits**: Modify how the subclass moves and interacts with the environment
- **Mutation Traits**: Provide additional bonuses and enhancements triggered by Bitcoin confirmation milestones

## Gameplay Considerations

- ATTACK subclasses excel at dealing damage but may be vulnerable to crowd control
- Higher rarity subclasses have more complex attack patterns and stronger crowd control effects
- The ordering of secondary roles creates unique playstyles within each subclass
- ATTACK subclasses counter CONTROL subclasses but are countered by DEFENSE subclasses
