- **DEFENSE**: Adds protection or damage reduction effects to control abilities
- **MOVEMENT**: Adds speed or mobility effects to control abilities

## Integration with Traits

CONTROL subclasses integrate with the trait system in several ways:

- **Formation Traits**: Modify the spatial arrangement of particles, affecting spell patterns
- **Behavior Traits**: Modify how the subclass moves and interacts with the environment
- **Mutation Traits**: Provide additional bonuses and enhancements triggered by Bitcoin confirmation milestones

## Gameplay Considerations

- CONTROL subclasses excel at utility and crowd control but may lack raw damage output
- Higher rarity subclasses have more powerful spells and control effects
- The ordering of secondary roles creates unique playstyles within each subclass
- CONTROL subclasses counter MOVEMENT subclasses but are countered by DEFENSE subclasses
- Crowd control abilities are a key feature of CONTROL subclasses, with higher rarities offering more powerful and longer-lasting effects
