## Implementation Phases

The project is implemented in the following phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Standardization and foundation
2. **Phase 2**: Core systems and architecture
3. **Phase 3**: Visual traits implementation
4. **Phase 4**: Particle roles and hierarchy
5. **Phase 5**: Physics and force fields
6. **Phase 6**: Evolution and mutation system
7. **Phase 7**: Advanced behaviors and interactions
8. **Phase 8**: Bitcoin integration and deployment

Each phase has its own implementation checklist, guide, and template.
