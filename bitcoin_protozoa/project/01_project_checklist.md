## Introduction

The Bitcoin Protozoa project will be implemented in phases, with each phase building upon a working implementation from the previous phase. This approach ensures that we have a functional application at each stage of development, rather than building everything separately and integrating at the end.

### Key Principles

1. **Working Implementation First**: Each phase will result in a working implementation before moving to the next phase
2. **Incremental Development**: Features will be added incrementally, with each phase focusing on a specific aspect
3. **Continuous Testing**: Testing will be performed throughout each phase, not just at the end
4. **Documentation Integration**: Each phase will reference relevant documentation from the Bitcoin Protozoa project
5. **Clean-up and Refinement**: Each phase will include a clean-up and refinement period before moving to the next phase

### Phase Overview

1. **Project Setup and Basic Particle System**: Set up the project structure and implement a basic particle system
2. **Bitcoin Integration**: Integrate with Bitcoin blockchain for data and RNG
3. **Visual Traits Implementation**: Implement visual traits for particles
4. **Particle Roles and Hierarchy**: Implement particle roles and hierarchy
5. **Force Field System**: Implement force fields for particle interaction
6. **UI Elements**: Implement user interface elements
7. **Advanced Behaviors**: Implement advanced particle behaviors
8. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize performance for large particle counts
9. **Testing and Refinement**: Comprehensive testing and refinement
10. **Deployment Preparation**: Prepare for deployment on Bitcoin blockchain

## Implementation Approach

### Script-Based Implementation

The Bitcoin Protozoa project is implemented using a systematic, script-based approach that prioritizes bulk batch processing over individual edits. This approach significantly improves efficiency, reduces implementation time, and ensures consistency across the codebase.

#### Key Principles

- **Systematic Phases**: Implement the project in clearly defined phases, with each phase building on the previous one.
- **Bulk Batch Processing**: Use PowerShell scripts to implement features in bulk batches rather than making individual edits.
- **Script Generation**: Create scripts that generate other scripts, maximizing automation and reducing repetitive work.
- **Careful Preparation**: Invest time in thorough preparation and planning before executing scripts.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test scripts thoroughly before execution to ensure they produce the expected results.
- **Incremental Execution**: Execute scripts in small, manageable chunks to avoid timeouts and errors.

#### Implementation Process

1. **Planning**: Define all assets, components, and features needed for the phase.
2. **Script Generation**: Create scripts to generate all the necessary files.
3. **Script Execution**: Execute the scripts in small chunks to implement the phase.
4. **Testing**: Test the implementation to ensure it meets the requirements.
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the changes.
