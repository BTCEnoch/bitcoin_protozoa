# Project Management Summary

This directory contains documentation on project management, tracking, and requirements for the Bitcoin Protozoa project.

## Key Documents

- [Project Checklist](01_project_checklist.md) - Project requirements checklist
- [Project Inventory](02_project_inventory.md) - Documentation inventory and status
- [Roadmap and Questions](03_roadmap_and_questions.md) - Development roadmap and key questions

## Project Management Overview

The project management approach ensures organized development and tracking:

1. **Requirements Tracking**: Tracking project requirements and completion
2. **Documentation Inventory**: Maintaining an inventory of documentation
3. **Status Tracking**: Tracking the status of project components
4. **Priority Management**: Managing development priorities
5. **Quality Gates**: Ensuring quality at each development stage

## Project Checklist

The project checklist tracks all required components:

1. **Project Setup and Planning**: Environment setup and architecture planning
2. **Core Systems Implementation**: Particle system, physics engine, etc.
3. **Bitcoin Integration**: Blockchain data integration, evolution mechanics, etc.
4. **User Interface and Experience**: Development UI, production UI, etc.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Memory management, rendering optimization, etc.
6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Unit testing, integration testing, etc.
7. **Deployment and Operations**: Build process, inscription process, etc.
8. **Documentation**: Technical documentation, user documentation, etc.

## Project Inventory

The project inventory tracks the status of all documentation:

1. **Documentation Status**: Complete, in progress, or pending
2. **Priority Levels**: P0 (critical) to P3 (low priority)
3. **Documentation References**: References to relevant documentation
4. **Implementation Notes**: Notes on implementation status
5. **Documentation Gaps**: Identification of documentation gaps

## Roadmap and Questions

The roadmap and questions document outlines the development plan and addresses key questions:

1. **Development Roadmap**: Phased approach to development
   - Phase 1: Foundation - Project setup and basic particle system
   - Phase 2: Core Features - Visual traits and basic interactions
   - Phase 3: Bitcoin Integration - Evolution mechanics and mutations
   - Phase 4: Advanced Features - Particle roles and force fields
   - Phase 5: Finalization - Optimization and deployment preparation

2. **Key Questions**: Important questions to address during development
   - Technical questions about implementation approaches
   - Design questions about visual and behavioral aspects
   - Bitcoin integration questions about blockchain interaction
   - Testing questions about validation approaches
   - User experience questions about interface and interaction

3. **Decision Points**: Critical decisions to make during development
   - Architecture decisions about code organization
   - Implementation decisions about technical approaches
   - Deployment decisions about inscription strategy

4. **Future Enhancements**: Planned features for future versions
   - Combat Arena (PvP) for particle creatures to battle
   - Breeding System for creating new creatures from existing ones
   - Advanced visual effects and environmental interactions

## AI Rules

The AI rules document outlines guidelines for working with AI during implementation:

1. **AI Limitations**: Understanding and working within AI constraints
   - Token limits for context, responses, and code blocks
   - Processing limitations for complex operations
   - Memory limitations for session information

2. **File Editing Guidelines**: Best practices for file editing
   - Edit in 250-line chunks to prevent technical issues
   - View files in chunks of up to 1000 lines
   - Create files incrementally in manageable sections

3. **Code Implementation Guidelines**: Best practices for code implementation
   - Modular design and clean architecture
   - Type safety and comprehensive error handling
   - Incremental development and test-driven approach

4. **Script Development Guidelines**: Best practices for script development
   - Develop all scripts for PowerShell with semicolons separating commands
   - Implement robust error handling in scripts
   - Test scripts thoroughly before integration

5. **Regular Review Process**: Process for maintaining quality
   - Review rules every few responses
   - Focus on relevant sections before complex tasks
   - Continuously improve and refine processes

## Status Indicators

The project uses the following status indicators:

1. **‚úÖ Complete**: Item is complete and verified
2. **üîÑ In Progress**: Item is currently being worked on
3. **‚è±Ô∏è Pending**: Item is planned but not started
4. **üö´ Blocked**: Item is blocked by dependencies
5. **üîç Under Review**: Item is complete but under review

## Priority Levels

The project uses the following priority levels:

1. **P0**: Critical path, must be completed for minimal viable product
2. **P1**: High priority, required for full functionality
3. **P2**: Medium priority, important for good user experience
4. **P3**: Low priority, nice-to-have features or optimizations
