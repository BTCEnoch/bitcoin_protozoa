## Phase 4: Particle Roles and Hierarchy

### 1. What particle roles will be implemented?
The particle system will implement five distinct roles for each creature, as defined in the documentation:

- **CORE**: The central, foundational particles that define the creature's identity and stability, acting as the nucleus of the system.
- **CONTROL**: Particles that direct and influence the behavior of other particles, functioning as the "brain" or command center.
- **MOVEMENT**: Particles responsible for the creature's locomotion, resembling fins or appendages that drive motion.
- **DEFENSE**: Protective particles that stabilize the creature and form a membrane-like boundary around the core.
- **ATTACK**: Aggressive particles that exhibit expansive behavior, patrolling the perimeter and engaging with external entities.

These five roles—CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, and ATTACK—will be fully implemented to create dynamic, role-specialized creatures.

### 2. How will roles affect particle behavior?
Each role imparts unique behavioral characteristics that dictate how particles move and interact within the creature:

- **CORE**: These particles are stable, with low variance in traits and high influence over others. Their behavior focuses on maintaining the creature's structural integrity.
- **CONTROL**: These particles exhibit moderate variance and perform gyroscopic or orbital movements around the CORE, directing the actions of other roles.
- **MOVEMENT**: High variance in speed and direction characterizes these particles, enabling propulsion through locomotive patterns.
- **DEFENSE**: With moderate variance, these particles maintain fixed positions relative to the CORE, forming a protective barrier.
- **ATTACK**: These particles display high variance and aggressive, outward movement, patrolling or interacting with the environment.

The roles influence behavior through:
- **Force Rules**: A force calculation matrix governs attraction and repulsion between roles, shaping their relative movements.
- **Role-Specific Modifiers**: Each role has a modifier (e.g., CORE at 1.5x influence) that adjusts its impact in force calculations.
- **Behavioral Traits**: Role-specific traits define distinct movement patterns and environmental interactions.

### 3. How will the role hierarchy be structured?
The role hierarchy is organized with the CORE at the top, exerting influence over all other roles:

- **CORE**: The central authority, influencing all subordinate roles.
- **CONTROL**: Directly influenced by CORE, it governs MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, and ATTACK.
- **MOVEMENT**: Controlled by CONTROL, it drives the creature's locomotion.
- **DEFENSE**: Under CONTROL's influence, it safeguards the CORE and other roles.
- **ATTACK**: Also influenced by CONTROL, it handles external interactions.

This hierarchy is maintained through:
- **Force Fields**: Each role has a force field that contains and influences particles of that role, aligned with the hierarchy.
- **Influence Strength**: Influence weakens as roles are farther from CORE in the hierarchy.
- **Containment Rules**: Force fields can only contain particles of roles they are designed to influence (e.g., CORE fields can contain all roles, while DEFENSE fields focus on DEFENSE particles).

### 4. How will roles be assigned based on Bitcoin data?
Particle roles are assigned deterministically using the Bitcoin block nonce, ensuring uniqueness for each creature:

- **Base Allocation**: Each of the five roles starts with 40 particles, totaling 200 particles.
- **Dynamic Allocation**: The remaining 300 particles (out of 500 total) are distributed based on random number generator (RNG) values derived from the block nonce.

The distribution algorithm is as follows:
1. Assign 40 base particles to each role (CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK).
2. Generate five RNG values between 0.1 and 0.3 using the block nonce.
3. Normalize these values to sum to 1.0.
4. Multiply each normalized value by 300 to calculate additional particles per role.
5. Round to integers, adjusting as needed to ensure the total equals 300.

This method guarantees a consistent yet varied role distribution tied to each creature's Bitcoin block data.

### 5. How will role-based interactions be implemented?
Role-based interactions are driven by a combination of systems:

- **Force Calculation Matrix**: A matrix defines attraction (positive values) and repulsion (negative values) between roles. For example:
  ```
                    | Core | Control | Movement | Defense | Attack
  ------------------|------|---------|----------|---------|--------
  Core particle     | +0.5 |   +0.8  |   +0.3   |   +0.2  |  -0.1
  Control particle  | +0.8 |   +0.3  |   +0.6   |   +0.4  |  +0.2
  Movement particle | +0.3 |   +0.6  |   +0.2  |   +0.3  |  +0.5
  Defense particle  | +0.2 |   +0.4  |   +0.3  |   +0.4  |  +0.7
  Attack particle   | -0.1 |   +0.2  |   +0.5  |   +0.7  |  +0.3
  ```
- **Role Modifiers**: Each role has a multiplier (e.g., CORE: 1.5, CONTROL: 1.2) that amplifies its influence in force calculations.
- **Force Fields**: Role-specific force fields exert containment and formation forces on their respective particles.
- **Behavioral Traits**: Role-specific behaviors dictate how particles respond to forces and interact with each other and the environment.

This multi-layered approach ensures complex, role-driven dynamics within the creature.

## Phase 5: Force Field System

### 1. What types of force fields will be implemented?
The force field system will implement five role-specific types, each tailored to its corresponding particle role:

- **CORE Force Fields**: Dense, central polygonal fields with minimal movement, anchoring the creature.
- **CONTROL Force Fields**: Gyroscopic polygonal fields with 3D rotation, orbiting the CORE to direct behavior.
- **MOVEMENT Force Fields**: Elongated polygonal fields resembling fins or phylanges, enabling locomotion.
- **DEFENSE Force Fields**: Regular polygonal fields forming a membrane-like boundary for protection.
- **ATTACK Force Fields**: Angular polygonal fields patrolling the perimeter, supporting aggressive behavior.

Each type is designed to complement its role's function and behavior.

### 2. How will force fields interact with particles?
Force fields interact with particles in the following ways:

- **Containment**: They exert forces to keep particles within their designated boundaries.
- **Influence**: Fields apply role-specific forces that shape particle movement and behavior (e.g., orbital motion for CONTROL).
- **Hierarchy**: Fields influence particles of roles they can contain, with influence strength decreasing as roles diverge in the hierarchy (e.g., CORE fields affect all particles, while ATTACK fields primarily affect ATTACK particles).

This interaction ensures that force fields reinforce the role hierarchy and behavioral dynamics.

### 3. How will force fields be generated from Bitcoin data?
Force fields are generated deterministically using the Bitcoin block nonce and merkle root:

```typescript
function determineForceFieldProperty(
  fieldId: string,
  property: string,
  blockData: BlockData
): number {
  const hash = deterministicHash(fieldId + property + blockData.merkleRoot);
  return normalizeHash(hash, 0, 1);
}
```

- **Shape**: RNG determines the number of vertices, size, and rotation speed of each field.
- **Properties**: Strength, influence range, and other attributes are set based on RNG values.
- **Hierarchy**: The field's role and position within the creature's structure enforce its hierarchical influence.

This approach ties force field characteristics to the creature's unique Bitcoin data.

### 4. How will force fields be visualized?
In the final rendering, force fields are **invisible**, acting solely as containers and influencers of particle behavior. However, for development and debugging, the Development UI provides visualization tools:

- **Force Field Boundaries**: A toggle to display the outlines of force fields.
- **Influence Areas**: Visual representations of the regions where fields exert influence.
- **Field Interactions**: Displays showing how fields interact with each other and with particles.

These tools aid in refining the system without affecting the end-user experience.

### 5. How will force field performance be optimized?
Performance optimization for force fields includes:

- **Spatial Partitioning**: A grid-based system limits interaction checks to nearby particles and fields.
- **Distance Cutoff**: Forces are calculated only for particles within a field's influence range.
- **Web Workers**: Force calculations are offloaded to separate threads to avoid UI lag.
- **SIMD Operations**: Parallel processing with SIMD instructions speeds up force computations.
- **Batch Processing**: Particles are processed in batches for better cache efficiency.
- **Bounding Spheres**: Quick containment tests use bounding spheres around fields.

These techniques ensure scalability and efficiency, even with 500+ particles and multiple force fields.

## Phase 6: UI Elements

### 1. What UI elements will be implemented?
The Bitcoin Protozoa UI will feature a minimal set of elements to keep the focus on the particle creatures while providing essential functionality:

- **Creature View**: The primary display area, occupying most of the screen, showcasing the particle creature.
- **Information Panel**: A collapsible panel displaying creature stats and Bitcoin block data.
- **Controls**: Basic interaction tools (e.g., camera rotation, zoom) with a streamlined design.
- **Evolution Timeline**: An optional view of the creature's mutation history.
- **Settings Panel**: A minimal interface for user preferences like theme selection.

These elements prioritize simplicity and immersion.

### 2. How will the UI be designed to be minimalistic yet informative?
The UI design balances minimalism and utility through these principles:

- **Dark Background**: A deep, space-like color (#1A1A1A) highlights the particle creatures.
- **Semi-Transparent Panels**: Panels blend into the scene without obstructing the view.
- **Collapsible Elements**: Users can hide panels to focus on the creature.
- **Subtle Animations**: Smooth transitions maintain immersion during interactions.

- **Camera Controls**: Rotate, zoom, and pan the creature view using mouse, touch, or keyboard inputs.
- **Panel Toggles**: Expand or collapse panels with a click or tap.
- **Settings Adjustments**: Modify preferences (e.g., theme, motion settings) via the settings panel.

These inputs are designed for accessibility and ease of use across devices.

## Phase 7: Advanced Behaviors

### 1. What advanced behaviors will be implemented?
The particle creatures will exhibit complex, organic behaviors, including:

- **Flocking**: Particles move as a cohesive group.
- **Pulsation**: Groups rhythmically expand and contract.
- **Rotation**: Groups spin around their center of mass.
- **Oscillation**: Wave-like patterns ripple through particle chains.
- **Bifurcation**: Groups split apart and recombine dynamically.

These behaviors, assigned by role and randomness, create lifelike animations.

### 2. How will behaviors be triggered and controlled?
Behaviors are initiated and managed through:

- **Force Fields**: Apply forces to trigger and sustain movements (e.g., orbits).
- **Role-Specific Traits**: Each role has unique behaviors (e.g., CONTROL triggers rotation).
- **Environmental Stimuli**: Proximity to boundaries or other creatures activates responses.

Control is fine-tuned with:

- **Behavioral Parameters**: Define strength, frequency, and duration.
- **Influence Strength**: Role hierarchy dictates behavior dominance.

This system ensures coordinated yet dynamic motion.

### 3. How will behaviors interact with the force field system?
Behaviors and force fields work together seamlessly:

- **Containment**: Fields keep behaviors within bounds.
- **Influence**: Fields shape patterns (e.g., CONTROL fields drive orbits).
- **Hierarchy Enforcement**: Fields prioritize behaviors based on role structure.

This integration produces natural, physics-driven animations.

### 4. How will behaviors be generated from Bitcoin data?
Behaviors are derived deterministically from the Bitcoin block nonce:

- **RNG Streams**: Independent random number streams assign behaviors to categories.
- **Trait Selection**: RNG picks behaviors from role-specific pools.
- **Parameter Tuning**: RNG adjusts behavior attributes (e.g., flocking intensity).

This ties each creature's unique behavior set to its associated Bitcoin block.

### 5. How will behavior performance be optimized?
To handle large particle counts efficiently:

- **Spatial Partitioning**: Calculates behaviors only for nearby particles.
- **Batch Processing**: Groups particles for faster computation.
- **Web Workers**: Offloads behavior logic to separate threads.
