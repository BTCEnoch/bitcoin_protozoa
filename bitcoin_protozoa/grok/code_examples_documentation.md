# Bitcoin Protozoa Code Examples

This directory contains code examples for the Bitcoin Protozoa project, organized by development phases. These examples serve as reference implementations and documentation for key components and features of the project.

## Directory Structure

- **phase1/**: Basic Particle System examples
- **phase2/**: Bitcoin Integration examples
- **phase3/**: Visual Traits Implementation examples
- **phase4/**: Particle Roles and Hierarchy examples
- **phase5/**: Force Field System examples
- **phase6/**: UI Elements examples
- **phase7/**: Advanced Behaviors examples
- **phase8/**: Performance Optimization examples
- **phase9/**: Testing and Refinement examples
- **phase10/**: Deployment Preparation examples

## Purpose

These code examples serve multiple purposes:

1. **Documentation**: They provide concrete examples of how to implement various features
2. **Reference**: They serve as reference implementations for developers
3. **Testing**: They can be used to verify that implementations meet requirements
4. **Learning**: They help new developers understand the codebase

## Usage

Each example includes:

- Source code with detailed comments
- Explanation of the implementation
- Usage examples
- References to relevant documentation

## Contributing

When adding new examples:

1. Place them in the appropriate phase directory
2. Include comprehensive comments
3. Add a README.md file explaining the example
4. Reference relevant architecture documentation
