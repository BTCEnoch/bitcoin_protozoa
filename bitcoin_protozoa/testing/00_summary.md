- [Error Handling](02_error_handling.md) - Error handling strategy and recovery
- [Technical Implementation](03_technical_implementation.md) - Technical implementation details
- [Development UI](04_development_ui.md) - Development UI for testing

## Testing Strategy Overview

The testing strategy ensures the reliability and performance of the Bitcoin Protozoa project:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing component interactions
3. **Performance Testing**: Testing performance under various conditions
4. **Bitcoin Integration Testing**: Testing Bitcoin data integration
5. **Visual Testing**: Testing visual appearance and animations

## Testing Tools

The project uses the following testing tools:

1. **Vitest**: For unit and integration testing
2. **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
3. **Performance Monitoring**: For performance testing
4. **Mock Bitcoin Data**: For testing Bitcoin integration
5. **Visual Regression Testing**: For testing visual appearance

## Testing Approach

The testing approach follows these principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests before implementation
2. **Component Isolation**: Testing components in isolation
3. **Realistic Scenarios**: Testing with realistic data and scenarios
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Testing against performance targets
5. **Continuous Testing**: Running tests continuously during development

## Error Handling Strategy

The error handling strategy ensures robustness and recovery:

1. **Error Types**: Categorizing errors by type and severity
2. **Error Boundaries**: Containing errors to prevent cascading failures
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Providing fallbacks for critical functionality
4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Tracking errors for debugging
5. **User Feedback**: Providing appropriate feedback to users

## Error Recovery

The error recovery approach includes:

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Maintaining core functionality when possible
2. **State Recovery**: Recovering from state corruption
3. **Retry Mechanisms**: Retrying failed operations
4. **Offline Support**: Functioning without network access
5. **Data Validation**: Validating data to prevent errors

## Technical Implementation

The technical implementation details include:

1. **Code Organization**: Structuring test code for maintainability
2. **Performance Testing**: Measuring and optimizing performance
3. **Security Testing**: Ensuring security of the application
4. **Deployment Testing**: Verifying deployment readiness
5. **Implementation Examples**: Practical examples of test implementation
