## Overview

Bitcoin Protozoa has two organizational systems for traits:

1. **Role-Based Organization**: Traits are organized by particle role (CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK)
2. **Category-Based Organization**: Traits are categorized by effect type (Stat Buffs, Special Formations, Special Abilities, Special Behaviors, Strange Occurrences)

This document maps between these two systems to ensure consistent implementation and balanced gameplay.

## Trait Categories

The balancing system defines five trait categories:

1. **Stat Buffs**: Enhances a stat (e.g., +15% Attack)
   - Direct numerical improvements to attributes
   - Examples: HP boost, damage increase, speed enhancement

2. **Special Formations**: Alters combat positioning (e.g., shield allies)
   - Spatial arrangements of particles
   - Examples: protective formations, offensive formations, evasive patterns

3. **Special Abilities**: Unique skills (e.g., poison, teleport)
   - Active abilities that can be triggered
   - Examples: projectile attacks, healing pulses, teleportation

4. **Special Behaviors**: Reactive effects (e.g., retaliate when hit)
   - Passive or reactive behaviors
   - Examples: counterattacks, automatic healing, passive auras

5. **Strange Occurrences**: Rare, situational effects (e.g., revive once per battle)
   - Unusual or powerful effects that don't fit other categories
   - Examples: resurrection, time manipulation, reality warping

## Role-Based Traits

The Bitcoin Protozoa project organizes traits by particle role:

1. **CORE Traits**: Related to the central, stabilizing force of the creature
   - Purpose: Provides durability and constitution
   - Examples: energy management, stability enhancement, regeneration

2. **CONTROL Traits**: Related to the directive force of the creature
   - Purpose: Provides intelligence and control effects
   - Examples: coordination enhancement, skill manipulation, debuff application

3. **MOVEMENT Traits**: Related to the locomotive force of the creature
   - Purpose: Provides agility and speed
   - Examples: speed boosts, evasion techniques, terrain navigation

4. **DEFENSE Traits**: Related to the protective force of the creature
   - Purpose: Provides damage mitigation and resilience
   - Examples: shields, damage reduction, status resistance

5. **ATTACK Traits**: Related to the offensive force of the creature
   - Purpose: Provides damage and combat strength
   - Examples: damage enhancement, critical strikes, penetration

## Mapping Approach

To map between role-based traits and trait categories, we use the following approach:

1. **Primary Effect Analysis**: Examine the primary effect of each trait to determine its category
2. **Role Consideration**: Consider the role's natural tendencies when categorizing ambiguous traits
3. **Balance Maintenance**: Ensure a balanced distribution of categories across roles
4. **Rarity Alignment**: Align rarity tiers with appropriate category power levels

> **Note**: The mutation trait distribution has been rebalanced from the original implementation to ensure a more even distribution across categories. This provides better gameplay balance and more variety in trait effects.

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Trait Selection Algorithm

When implementing the trait selection system, consider the following guidelines:

- **Formation and Behavior Traits**: Select one trait per role using deterministic RNG based on Bitcoin block nonce.
- **Mutation Traits**: Select based on Bitcoin confirmation milestones, with rarity distribution dependent on confirmation count.
- **Category Balance**: Consider the category distribution when selecting traits to ensure balanced gameplay.

### 2. Class System Integration

The class system should integrate with the trait system as follows:

- **Main Class**: Determined by the highest particle group (CORE → Healer, CONTROL → Caster, etc.).
- **Subclass**: Determined by the full ranking of all five groups (24 subclasses per main class).
- **Trait Effects**: Traits should modify class abilities based on their category:
  - Stat Buffs: Enhance base stats of the class.
  - Special Formations: Modify positioning and spatial effects.
  - Special Abilities: Add or enhance active abilities.
  - Special Behaviors: Add or enhance passive or reactive behaviors.
  - Strange Occurrences: Provide unique, powerful effects.

### 3. Balancing Considerations

- **Rarity Scaling**: Ensure trait effects scale appropriately with rarity.
- **Category Synergy**: Consider how traits from different categories interact.
- **Role Compatibility**: Ensure traits are compatible with their roles.
- **Class Synergy**: Consider how traits interact with class abilities.

### 4. Implementation Approach

1. **Define Trait Data**: Store trait definitions in TypeScript files organized by role and category.
2. **Implement Selection Logic**: Create functions to select traits based on Bitcoin data.
3. **Create Effect System**: Implement a system to apply trait effects to creatures.
4. **Integrate with Class System**: Ensure traits modify class abilities appropriately.
5. **Test and Balance**: Test with various Bitcoin data to ensure balanced trait distribution.
