# Trait Category Mapping

This document maps our role-based formation and behavior traits to the five trait categories defined in the balancing system.

## Trait Categories Overview

The balancing system defines five trait categories:

1. **Stat Buffs**: Enhances a stat (e.g., +15% Attack)
2. **Special Formations**: Alters combat positioning (e.g., shield allies)
3. **Special Abilities**: Unique skills (e.g., poison, teleport)
4. **Special Behaviors**: Reactive effects (e.g., retaliate when hit)
5. **Strange Occurrences**: Rare, situational effects (e.g., revive once per battle)

## Mapping Approach

Each of our role-based traits (both formation and behavior) will be mapped to one of these five categories based on its primary effect. This mapping allows us to maintain our role-based organization while aligning with the category-based balancing system.
