# Documentation Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to the trait balance structure documentation to eliminate redundancies, resolve conflicts, and enhance clarity.

## Changes Made

### 1. Standardized Terminology

- Updated all documents to use consistent role names: CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK
- Ensured consistent capitalization (all uppercase) for role names
- Updated class names to match the new system: Healer, Caster, Striker, Tank, Rogue

### 2. Confirmed and Standardized Rarity Tiers

- Standardized on a 6-tier system: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythic
- Updated rarity probabilities: Common (40%), Uncommon (30%), Rare (20%), Epic (8%), Legendary (1.5%), Mythic (0.5%)
- Added Mythic tier to point values (50 points)
- Updated perfect creature odds to include Mythic tier

### 3. Rebalanced Trait Category Distribution

- Adjusted mutation trait distribution to be more balanced:
  - Stat Buffs: 40.0% (down from 70.0%)
  - Special Formations: 10.0% (up from 0.5%)
  - Special Abilities: 20.0% (up from 15.0%)
  - Special Behaviors: 20.0% (up from 10.0%)
  - Strange Occurrences: 10.0% (up from 4.5%)
- Updated combined category distribution to reflect these changes

### 4. Updated Particle Distribution References

- Changed from percentage-based distribution to direct allocation
- Updated minimum particles per role from 40.3 to 43
- Updated distribution method description to reflect the new approach
- Updated rarity of extremes description
- Updated particle count ranges by rarity tier:
  - Common (40%): 43–95 particles (was 70–141)
  - Uncommon (30%): 96–110 particles (was 50–69 and 142–155)
  - Rare (20%): 111–125 particles (was 40–49 and 156–171)
  - Epic (8%): 126–141 particles (was 172–185)
  - Legendary (1.5%): 142–151 particles (was 186–188)
  - Mythic (0.5%): 152–220 particles (was 189–220)

### 5. Fully Integrated Class System Details

- Updated class system from optional to mandatory
- Added detailed description of main class and subclass determination
- Added explanation of how all five groups contribute to subclass distinction
- Added examples of how subclasses with the same top three groups differ

### 6. Consolidated Implementation Plans

- Marked older implementation plan as archived
- Added reference to the updated implementation plan
- Updated particle distribution and class system sections in the archived plan
- Ensured consistency between the two plans

### 7. Clarified Mutation Traits as a Trait Type

- Updated references from "mutation perks" to "mutation traits"
- Added note clarifying that mutations are a type of trait, not separate perks
- Updated implementation approach to reflect this clarification

### 8. Enhanced Documentation with Visual Aids

- Added flowchart for trait mapping in the trait category mapping document
- Added class determination diagram in the class system implementation document
- Added subclass modifier table in the class system implementation document
