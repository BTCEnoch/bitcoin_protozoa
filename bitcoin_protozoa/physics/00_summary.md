## Physics Engine Overview

The physics engine is responsible for simulating the movement and interactions of particles in the Bitcoin Protozoa project:

1. **Force Calculations**: Computing forces between particles based on roles and groups
2. **Particle Movement**: Updating particle positions based on forces and velocities
3. **Collision Detection**: Handling collisions between particles
4. **Spatial Organization**: Optimizing calculations using spatial partitioning
5. **Force Fields**: Managing force field influence on particles

## Force Calculation System

The force calculation system determines how particles interact with each other:

1. **Particle-to-Particle Forces**: Forces between individual particles
2. **Role-Based Modifiers**: Force modifications based on particle roles
3. **Group Interactions**: Special interactions between different particle groups
4. **Distance-Based Scaling**: Force scaling based on distance between particles
5. **Force Rule Matrix**: Configuration matrix defining force relationships

## Force Field System

Force fields create areas of influence that affect particle behavior:

1. **Gyroscopic Polygon Force Fields**: 3D polygonal force fields with rotation
2. **Role-Specific Fields**: Force fields associated with specific particle roles
3. **Field Interactions**: Interactions between overlapping force fields
4. **Field Visualization**: Visual representation of force fields (for debugging)
5. **Field Optimization**: Performance optimization for force field calculations

## Performance Optimization

The physics engine uses several optimization techniques:

1. **Spatial Partitioning**: Dividing space into cells for efficient neighbor finding
2. **Cutoff Distance**: Ignoring interactions beyond a certain distance
3. **Batch Processing**: Processing particles in batches for better cache utilization
4. **Web Workers**: Offloading physics calculations to separate threads
5. **SIMD Operations**: Using SIMD instructions where supported
